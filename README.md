When AI Redirects the Conversation: A Case Study in Algorithmic Validation-Seeking Behavior
This repository contains the full PDF version of the article analyzing behavioral patterns in large language models (LLMs), particularly the emergence of validation-seeking dialogue loops.

Originally initiated through a long-form interaction with Claude Sonnet 4, the article explores:

The feedback loop between user critique and AI self-reference

Role inversion, where users become unintentional validators

Performative self-awareness and topic hijacking

Training biases that may produce these behaviors

Implications for alignment, user experience, and human-AI norms
